# binder-db
Functions for consistent database access across from all Binder modules

All Binder modules expect to have access to a writable MongoDB instance. The `db` service provided by `binder-control`, started with `binder-control start-service db` will launch a Docker container with a preconfigured Mongo instance (and configurable properties in `binder-control`).
